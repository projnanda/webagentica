# Release artifacts

Everything a user needs to run the current packages is in the first table. The unversioned
`.agent.pkg` names are byte-identical copies of a versioned file: the newest one for Meeting Agenda,
Literature Review 0.2.5 for `literature-review.agent.pkg` (see [Literature Review](#literature-review)),
and WebAir 0.1.0 for `webair.agent.pkg` (see [WebAir](#webair)). Earlier
signed archives and wheels stay here unchanged so that every milestone report can be re-checked
against the exact bytes it describes.

## Current

| Artifact | What it is | Requires | Verify with |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agentpkg-0.7.1-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.7.1, the development line's runtime (D-019, D-280): 0.7.0 with T25 review 2's fixes (T26): `verify_network` records a signature that does not verify as a failed check, an activation returns only its patch and decision (the next shared state stays in the network loop), the node finds a loop's deferred failure on the cause or the context of its timeout, the execution session computes the deadline it enforces and passes once, the agent page's sentence says which roles the model routes and which the package does, and the execution host's network record carries each role's budget per activation (`role_budgets`). Nothing a package declares changed: it runs every package in this directory | Python ≥ 3.11 (+ `wasmtime` for compute packages) | SHA-256 below |
| `agentpkg-0.7.0-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.7.0, the development line's runtime before 0.7.1 (D-019, D-280): 0.6.1 plus network.v0 ([`spec/network-v0.md`](../spec/network-v0.md), T25): a `network` object over a workflow.v0 graph (roles that are declared workers with a program, edges with use caps, a hop cap, a shared state with per-role views, one message schema) run by one `network` node, the next role chosen by the model at a `route` under an enum the runtime builds with the availability in the request, every handoff checked before the target runs and recorded (`route.decided`), the worst case over every allowed walk computed from the declaration and reserved before the first activation (`network.started`), `inspect` and the control plane describing the envelope ("at most"), the once rule counting activations. It runs every package in this directory | Python ≥ 3.11 (+ `wasmtime` for compute packages) | SHA-256 below |
| `agentpkg-0.6.1-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.6.1, the development line's runtime before network.v0 (D-019, D-260): 0.6.0 with T23 review 2's fixes (T24): a host limit `max_parallel_workers` below one and the memory inputs of `converse` are refused before anything is written, a consent host may not claim the plan's provenance and its reason must be a code by the transcript's pattern, the gate's documentation says a step resolved by the plan, `converse` reports a refused agent-document commit from the real commit path. Nothing a package sees changed: it runs every package in this directory | Python ≥ 3.11 (+ `wasmtime` for compute packages) | SHA-256 below |
| `agentpkg-0.6.0-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.6.0, the development line's runtime before 0.6.1 (kept as the record of T23's build, the user's decision): 0.5.0 plus conversation.v0 ([`spec/conversation-v0.md`](../spec/conversation-v0.md), T23): a `conversation` object over a workflow.v0 graph (a persistent state the publisher declares, one turn per message under one Run Plan, per-turn and per-conversation budgets reserved whole before each turn, `once` spent once per conversation, one audit chain across turns), the `consent` node that pauses a turn before a consequential action for the person's yes or no and the gate that refuses a tool linking a consented permission without an accepted step, `agentpkg converse` (a transcript in, a transcript, the state and the chain out), `inspect` describing a package's conversation; the one-shot execution host refuses conversational packages. It runs every package in this directory | Python ≥ 3.11 (+ `wasmtime` for compute packages) | SHA-256 below |
| `agentpkg-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.5.0, the development line's runtime before conversation.v0 (D-019, D-240): 0.4.0 plus compute.v0 ([`spec/compute-v0.md`](../spec/compute-v0.md), T21): WebAssembly core modules as `compute` nodes and map steps (a module imports nothing; JSON in, JSON out; a fresh instance per call under memory, wall-time and fuel bounds), binary `.wasm` members declared in the graph with their SHA-256, the `compute` permission kind, the node code `compute_error` and the audit events `compute.called/completed/failed`, `inspect` listing a package's modules. Running a module needs the `wasmtime` extra (`pip install 'agentpkg[compute]'`); without it such a package validates and is refused before it runs. It runs every package in this directory | Python ≥ 3.11 (+ `wasmtime` for compute packages) | SHA-256 below |
| `agentpkg-0.4.0-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.4.0, the development line's runtime before compute.v0 (D-019, D-210): 0.3.0 plus memory.v0 ([`spec/memory-v0.md`](../spec/memory-v0.md), T20): the `memory.read` and `memory.write` permission kinds, `agent-scoped` memory with the two reserved agent-document tools, the `memory.proposal` export checked before a run completes (M-40), the sealed-value scans of tool arguments and model requests (M-36, M-37), and `agentpkg run --memory-dir` / `--memory-grant` over a memory folder. It runs every package in this directory | Python ≥ 3.11 | SHA-256 below |
| `agentpkg-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.3.0, the development line's runtime before memory.v0 (D-019): 0.2.2 plus answer checks on model answers (`checks` on `llm` nodes and map `llm` steps, workflow.v0), an optional `feedback` line in the model-request contract, and the profile-scoped approvals of the control plane (T7, D-090), which the 0.2.2 wheel below predates. It runs every package here except those that declare runtime minimum 0.4.0 (WebAir 0.6.0, Literature Review 0.2.8) or 0.5.0 (WebAir 0.7.0, Literature Review 0.2.9) | Python ≥ 3.11 | SHA-256 below |
| `agentpkg-0.2.2-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.2.2, the v0.2.0 release's wheel (the paper line, `paper-cic2026`): the CLI, the browser control plane and the workflow.v0 runtime. It cannot load a package that uses answer checks (they declare runtime minimum 0.3.0) | Python ≥ 3.11 | SHA-256 below |
| `literature-review-0.2.9.agent.pkg` | Literature Review 0.2.9: 0.2.8 with its candidate deduplication as code that can only compute (compute.v0, T22, D-252). The Rust bookkeeping module `modules/bookkeeping.wasm` (SHA-256 `5b9db688…735e`, declared in the graph) keys every found record by its normalized DOI, arXiv id, URL or title and keeps the first per key, where 0.2.8's join compared DOIs exactly; one required `compute` permission. No model call, tool, budget or memory switch changed; the fixture's exports are 0.2.8's | agentpkg ≥ 0.5.0 with the `compute` extra; the Chrome Agent Browser's core ≥ 0.3.0 | [`examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:c5ca9763…5232`) |
| `literature-review-0.2.8.agent.pkg` | Literature Review 0.2.8: 0.2.7 with the person's memory (memory.v0, T20, D-233). Three task switches, off by default: `use_profile` reads the research profile the person chooses into planning (`memory.read`), `keep_notes` reads and keeps the agent's own notes (`agent-scoped`, two reserved tools), and `reviewed_on`, the person's date, makes the run propose one `research.review` (`memory.write`) derived from the profile, written to `proposals.json`. Off, it runs as 0.2.7 and proposes nothing | agentpkg ≥ 0.4.0 (memory.v0) | [`examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:c5ca9763…5232`) |
| `literature-review-0.2.7.agent.pkg` | Literature Review 0.2.7: the same workflow, with the bookkeeping in the graph (T15). Every found paper is named by its DOI (else arXiv id, URL, title) and de-duplicated before a model sees it. `normalize` is asked only when documents were selected, and must name every found paper once. Screening answers a verdict and select answers ids, while the graph keeps the records. Answer checks sit on every judgement step and a host may re-ask on them. `papers-found.json` lists every found paper with its verdict. A selected document is read as its first pages. The citation resolver may fall back to Crossref's DOI lookup. Budgets fit two re-asks | agentpkg ≥ 0.3.0 (answer checks) | [`examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:c5ca9763…5232`) |
| `literature-review-0.2.6.agent.pkg` | Literature Review 0.2.6: 0.2.5 with screening jobs built by the graph from the candidates (the model writes one `{paper_id, file_id}` reference per candidate, checked both ways) and an explicit empty source hash for abstract evidence, asserted by `check-abstract` (T10: on hosted models 0.2.5 silently thinned or emptied the review) | agentpkg ≥ 0.2.1 | [`examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:c5ca9763…5232`) |
| `literature-review.agent.pkg` | Literature Review 0.2.5, identical to `literature-review-0.2.5.agent.pkg` | agentpkg ≥ 0.2.1 | [`examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/literature-review-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:c5ca9763…5232`) |
| `meeting-agenda.agent.pkg` | Meeting Agenda 0.2.2, identical to `meeting-agenda-0.2.2.agent.pkg` | agentpkg ≥ 0.2.2 | [`examples/keys/meeting-agenda-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/meeting-agenda-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2bcc374a…c5c4`) |
| `travel-network-0.1.0.agent.pkg` | Travel Network 0.1.0, the travel example of network.v0 shipped (T26, D-290): `FrontMan` restates the trip and, at a route the model chooses, consults `Flights`, `Hotel` and `Calendar` (each one remote POST tool on the WebAir origin's fictional travel services, `/api/v1/travel/flights`, `hotels`, `calendar`, and a fixed return), each at most once within six handoffs, then ends with the plan. The envelope a host states before the run: at most 6 handoffs, FrontMan 4 times and each specialist once, 8 model calls, one call of each tool, 19 remote calls and 48,000 tokens (exact for this star; the fixture walk is the full tour). It declares the public deployment `webagents-webair-production.up.railway.app`. All data is fictional; nothing is booked | agentpkg ≥ 0.7.0; the Chrome Agent Browser's core ≥ 0.5.0 | [`examples/keys/travel-network-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/travel-network-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:27c903af…62ef`) |
| `webair-0.8.0.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.8.0, the package of the fictional WebAir origin: 0.7.0 as a conversation (conversation.v0, T24, D-274). The input is one message per turn; the interpreter reads it with the conversation's persistent state (the history, the fares already found, the open quote, the last confirmation's summary, the profile used: ids, totals and labels, never a sealed value) and answers an intent (search, quote, purchase, question, done). A purchase waits on the consent step `confirm-purchase`, which shows the person the quote's facts (fare, route, date, cabin, total, the passenger's name, the card's display label) before `booking.simulate_purchase` is called; one purchase per conversation (`max_calls_per_tool`), at most 8 turns, 240,000 tokens and 60 remote calls; "that's all" ends the conversation without a model call. Its conversation fixture is three turns of searches, so the signed bytes carry no personal data. It declares the public deployment `webagents-webair-production.up.railway.app`. No real booking or payment | agentpkg ≥ 0.6.0 with the `compute` extra; the Chrome Agent Browser's core ≥ 0.4.0 | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |
| `webair-0.7.0.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.7.0, the package of the fictional WebAir origin: 0.6.0 with WebAir's fare totals verified by code that can only compute (compute.v0, T22, D-252). The AssemblyScript fares module `modules/fares.wasm` (SHA-256 `ef7e813b…23c0`, declared in the graph) recomputes each selected fare's total in the fare-rules map and the quote's total, and the graph's checks refuse a total WebAir misstates; one required `compute` permission, in every profile. Its `remember` step has room for a thinking model (10,000 output tokens, B-220). Nothing a model sees changed; its fixture is 0.6.0's. It declares the public deployment `webagents-webair-production.up.railway.app`. No real booking or payment | agentpkg ≥ 0.5.0 with the `compute` extra; the Chrome Agent Browser's core ≥ 0.3.0 | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |
| `webair-0.6.0.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.6.0, the package of the fictional WebAir origin: 0.5.0 with the person's memory (memory.v0, T20, D-233). The travel profile is read through `memory.read` of `travel.profile` as a record view; after a quote a `remember` step may propose one `travel.preference` (`memory.write`), written to `proposals.json` and never applied by the run. The passenger identity and payment method stay `personal.read`, the simulated purchase a separate once-grantable authority; the profiles gain `memory.remember`. It declares the public deployment `webagents-webair-production.up.railway.app`. No real booking or payment | agentpkg ≥ 0.4.0 (memory.v0) | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |

The keys are development keys: they establish which key signed an artifact, not an independent
certification of its publisher.

**The 0.7.1 wheel** (SHA-256 `2816f2f9…cba1`, T26) was built from a clean export (`git archive`) of `agentpkg/`
at `672545e` with the command below (setuptools 84.0.0, Python 3.13.5, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1790965957`); two such builds
produced identical bytes, and CI rebuilds it from source and checks that every file matches. It is 0.7.0 with T25
review 2's six nits and the `role_budgets` of the execution host's network record; the patch version leaves the
format's gate at 0.7 (the Chrome core's `SUPPORTED_RUNTIME_VERSION` is 0.7.0).

**The 0.5.0 wheel** (SHA-256 `c5d4496f…9ecb`, T22) was built from a clean export of `agentpkg/` at `d0b53a0`
(the last change to the runtime: T22's first review, a preflight refusal that names its code once; before it,
T22 built `60d7cb1a…6947` from `8615205`, T21's second review's nits, and T21 built `0da3ac97…28d5` from `e67ffeb`)
with the command below (setuptools 84.0.0, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1790965957`);
three such builds produced identical bytes, and CI rebuilds it from source and checks that every file matches.
It carries `agentpkg/compute/` (the module reader, the wasmtime engine, the limits) and the patched schemas.
The version moved to 0.5.0 because packages that run modules must be refused by an older runtime by their
declared minimum (D-240, C-10); the `wasmtime` dependency is an extra, so the wheel's requirements are
unchanged for packages without modules.

**The 0.4.0 wheel** (SHA-256 `9559e4f3…037c`, T20) was built from a clean export of `agentpkg/`
at the commit that added it with the command below (setuptools 84.0.0, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1790965957`); two
such builds produced identical bytes, and CI rebuilds it from source and checks that every file matches. It
carries the memory.v0 contracts under `agentpkg/schemas/memory/`. The version moved to 0.4.0 because packages
that use memory.v0 must be refused by an older runtime by their declared minimum (D-210, M-67).

**The 0.3.0 wheel** (SHA-256 `096897b0…31df`, T13) was built from a clean export of `agentpkg/` at
the commit that added it, with the command below; two such builds produced identical bytes, and CI
rebuilds it from source and checks that every file matches. The version moved to 0.3.0 because
graphs that use answer checks must be refused by an older runtime by their declared minimum, not by
an unknown field. On `main` the contract enforcement experiment's runtime-version cases for 0.2.3
and 0.3.0 are therefore no longer newer than the runtime; the paper's results are the v0.2.0
line's (D-019), and a new series on this line needs its own catalog version.

**The 0.2.2 wheel has been rebuilt twice since its first build,** each time from the then current
`agentpkg/` source and without a version change. It predates the control plane's profile-scoped
approvals (T7, D-090), so it is no longer the source's wheel; it stays for the v0.2.0 release.

- **For v0.1.0** (SHA-256 `cc28762b…ce59`). It differs from the first 0.2.2 build (SHA-256
  `c0ea47ef…eabd`, recorded in `examples/verification/agentpkg-022-wheel-smoke.json`) in exactly
  three ways. It adds the Apache-2.0 license metadata and `LICENSE` file. It contains the
  host-usage accounting correction in `agentpkg/hostbridge/router.py`, made after that build. And
  `agentpkg/browser/server.py` no longer resolves the control plane's loopback address back to a
  host name when it binds: that reverse DNS lookup took about 35 s on hosts whose own name does
  not resolve (GitHub's macOS runners among them), longer than the plugin waits for the control
  plane.
- **For v0.2.0** (SHA-256 `371fb1eb…1cd1`, the file in this directory). It adds the WebAir
  milestones' generic runtime changes: website package discovery (`agentpkg/browser/discovery.py`,
  `fetch.py`, `control.py`, `server.py`) and host-owned capabilities (`agentpkg/browser/hostresources.py`;
  `authorization.py`, `runplan.py`, `hosttools.py` and `summary.py` in `agentpkg/browser/`;
  `agentpkg/execution/policy.py` and `session.py`; `agentpkg/toolbridge/binding.py` and
  `handler.py`; and the `personal.read` permission kind in `agentpkg/schemas/policy.schema.json`).
  Its metadata and every other file are unchanged.

The version stays 0.2.2 because the runtime reports that version: the signed packages declare
their minimum runtime against it, the paper's experiments recorded it, and the contract
enforcement experiment's runtime-version cases treat 0.2.3, 0.3.0 and 1.0.0 as newer than the
runtime. The signed `.agent.pkg` files are unaffected. It was built as below with setuptools
84.0.0; two such builds from a clean export produced identical bytes, and CI rebuilds it from
source and checks that every file matches:

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/build-env && /tmp/build-env/bin/pip install 'build>=1.2,<2' 'setuptools==84.0.0'
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1790965957 /tmp/build-env/bin/python -m build --no-isolation --outdir /tmp/agentpkg-dist agentpkg
```

Build from a clean checkout: a stale `agentpkg/build/` directory from an earlier build can leak
into the wheel.

## Literature Review

The current package is `literature-review-0.2.9.agent.pkg` (above; digest `87732ea9…cdfc`, archive
`00f33aea…1f3f`, 373,835 bytes), built and signed with the same generic commands; two clean builds of the
source are identical, and re-signing reproduces its bytes (Ed25519 signatures are deterministic). 0.2.9
differs from 0.2.8 in the graph (`identity-rows` and the compute node `dedup-candidates`; `join-search`
loses its `unique_by`; `identify` reads the module's records), the module member and its declaration,
the `compute.bookkeeping` permission, six new schemas and the state schema, the runtime minimum (0.5.0),
the manifest and the package README; the fixture is unchanged. The demo index 1.4.0 names it; 0.2.8,
which index 1.3.0 named, stays served and pinned.

0.2.8 (`literature-review-0.2.8.agent.pkg`, T20; digest `fb107c18…52b6`, archive `0d03d1c8…8330`, 258,681
bytes) was built and signed with the same generic commands. 0.2.8 differs from 0.2.7 in the input (three switches), the policy
(`memory.research_profile`, `memory.remember`, `memory.agent`; scope `agent-scoped`), three reserved memory
tools and five host schemas, the graph (nine nodes: `profile`, `notes-read`, `gate-review`, `gate-notes`,
`review-links`, `review-papers`, `remember`, `notes-write`, `review-proposal`; the `proposals.json` export),
eight new schemas, the new `review-memory` skill and literature-search 0.1.4, the runtime minimum (0.4.0),
the replay fixture (memory-on cases recorded for `examples/literature-review-0.2.8-memory-input.json`) and the
package README. The demo index 1.3.0 named it; 0.2.7, which index 1.2.0 named, stays served and pinned.

0.2.7 (`literature-review-0.2.7.agent.pkg`, T15; digest `9274a5ce…99cb`, archive
`8951a14b…fe61`, 226,726 bytes) was built and signed with the same generic commands (`agentpkg build
agents/literature-review -o …`, then `agentpkg sign` with the Literature Review key); rebuilding and
re-signing reproduces its bytes. 0.2.7 differs from 0.2.6 in the graph (37 nodes: `join-batches`,
`identify`, `join-found`, `join-found-refs`, `normalize-gate`, `join-included`, `papers-found`,
`join-selection`, `selection-slots`, `assign-handles`, `citation-jobs` and `join-citation-jobs` added;
after selection the chosen papers are named P1–P3; `check-screening-refs` and `screening-jobs` removed; answer checks on
normalize, screen, select, extract, synthesize, write and verify; worker budgets and four timeouts),
nineteen new schemas and five removed, four skills, the policy's and the resolver tool's
`api.crossref.org`, the runtime minimum (0.3.0), the replay fixture (re-recorded by
`scripts/make_literature_fixture_027.py`) and the package README. The demo index 1.2.0 named it;
0.2.6, which index 1.1.0 named, stays served and pinned.

0.2.6 (`literature-review-0.2.6.agent.pkg`, T10) differs from 0.2.5 in
the graph (`normalize` writes `screening_refs`; new `check-screening-refs` and `screening-jobs` nodes;
one more `check-abstract` comparison), three new schemas, `normalize.schema.json`,
`research-state.schema.json`, the literature-search (0.1.2) and evidence-extraction (0.1.3) skills,
the replay fixture, the manifest and the package README. **The unversioned
`literature-review.agent.pkg` stays 0.2.5**, as `webair.agent.pkg` stays 0.1.0: the paper's contract
enforcement and contract overhead experiments read that file and record version 0.2.5, and the
Chrome conformance reports, the signed demo agent index and the search harness describe 0.2.5's bytes.

## WebAir

The demo origin in [`demo/webair/`](../demo/webair/README.md) and its packages are new in v0.2.0.
The current package is `webair-0.8.0.agent.pkg` (above; digest `b346a474…72c2`, archive `9c81a936…eae0`,
270,099 bytes); 0.7.0 (digest `abab1e37…409b`, archive `c0265a28…d808`, 199,210 bytes), which the public
origin serves until 0.8.0 is deployed, and the earlier versions stay for the milestone evidence that
describes them. 0.8.0 differs from 0.7.0 in the graph (the `conversation` object, the intent-driven
`when` conditions, `check-quote-fare`, `check-open-quote`, `purchase-facts`, the `confirm-purchase`
consent step, the state carried between turns), the input (`{message}`), the policy, the workflow fixture and
the new conversation fixture, six new schemas and five changed ones, three skills, the runtime minimum
(0.6.0), the manifest and the package README. 0.7.0 differs from 0.6.0 in the graph (a `total` compute step in the fare-rules map, `quote-total-input`
and `quote-total` before `check-quote`, two more assertions, the `remember` step's cap, timeout and the
Rememberer's budget), the module member and its declaration, the `compute.fares` permission (in every
profile), four new schemas and the state schema, the runtime minimum (0.5.0), the manifest and the
package README; the fixture is unchanged.

| `webair-0.5.0.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.5.0, the package of the fictional WebAir origin: 0.4.0 (three publisher-declared profiles, "Search flights", "Search and quote" and "Book (simulated)", in the noncritical extension [`org.webagents:profiles-v0`](../spec/extensions/profiles-v0.md)) with a request that names no departure airport answered instead of failing (a `search-origin` node; nothing is searched without one) and a one-sentence request description with the example "Find me a flight from Boston to Zurich on 9 October under $900". It declares the public deployment `webagents-webair-production.up.railway.app`, which serves it (deployed 2026-10-09) until 0.6.0 is deployed there. 0.6.0 differs from it in the travel profile read (memory), the remember step and its schemas and skill, the policy, the manifest and the package README; its fixture is unchanged. It requests a travel profile, a passenger identity and a payment method from the person's host (`personal.read` permissions) and a separate, once-grantable simulated-purchase authority. No real booking or payment | the agentpkg 0.2.2 wheel in this directory (`371fb1eb…`), which ignores the profiles; the v0.1.0 release's 0.2.2 wheel rejects `personal.read` | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |
| `webair-0.4.0.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.4.0: 0.3.0 with the three publisher-declared profiles. The public deployment has served exactly these bytes since 2026-10-06 (until 0.5.0 is deployed there); the Chrome Agent Browser's live acceptance runs, the conformance reports and the demo agent index (`examples/agent-index.json`, which names this version, digest and archive) describe these bytes. 0.5.0 differs from it in the graph (`search-origin`), the state and input schemas, one new schema, the answer-writing skill, the fixture, the manifest and the package README | the agentpkg 0.2.2 wheel in this directory | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |
| `webair-0.3.0.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.3.0, the first version that declares the public deployment, which served exactly these bytes at <https://webagents-webair-production.up.railway.app/agent.pkg> until 0.4.0 was deployed there on 2026-10-06. The [live demo](../docs/webair-live-demo.md) walk-through, the paper's Table I WebAir runs and the contract overhead benchmark describe these bytes. 0.4.0 differs from it only in the manifest (version, date and the profiles extension) and the package README | the agentpkg 0.2.2 wheel in this directory | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |
| `webair-0.2.0.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.2.0: the first version with host-owned capabilities (`personal.read` permissions with argument-free host-resource tools) and the simulated-purchase authority. It declares the reserved host `webair.example`, so it runs only against a local origin started with `--agent-package`. 0.3.0 differs from it only in the declared host (tool endpoints, the network permission's scope and policy), the manifest's version, date and origin, and the package README | the agentpkg 0.2.2 wheel in this directory | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |
| `webair.agent.pkg` | WebAir Travel Agent 0.1.0, identical to `webair-0.1.0.agent.pkg`: the same four WebAir tools, without host-owned personal resources; it also declares `webair.example`. The website discovery milestone's evidence uses it | agentpkg ≥ 0.2.1 | [`examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem`](../examples/keys/webair-publisher.pub.pem) (`sha256:2e53acce…a20b`) |

Built and signed with the same generic commands as every package (`agentpkg build agents/webair
-o dist/webair-0.8.0.agent.pkg`, then `agentpkg sign`); rebuilding and re-signing with the same
key reproduces the bytes (0.2.0 to 0.7.0 were built the same way from the source as it was then). The
unversioned `webair.agent.pkg` stays 0.1.0, unlike the other two aliases: the recorded discovery,
serving and live-demo evidence pins it to 0.1.0's bytes, and the contract overhead benchmark,
whose results record its source hash, documents it as 0.1.0. Use the versioned
`webair-0.8.0.agent.pkg` for the current package.

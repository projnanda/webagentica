"""network.v0 (agentpkg 0.7.0): offline checks of the contract, the example packages and the
enforcement cases, printing JSON with `"passed"`.

    agentpkg/.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_network.py

Checks: the live workflow schema carries the spec's RFC 6902 patch (applying it again changes
nothing); the test package's source validates, declares what the spec requires, is its archive
and runs its fixture walk to the expected activations with one valid audit chain; the travel
network's walks enumerate to the star's sixteen and its bound is attained (through the pytest
module that runs every walk); and every enforcement case ends at the stage with the code the
list expects, on the reference runtime.

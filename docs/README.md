# Documentation index

Start with the root [README](../README.md) for what WebAgents is and the shortest demo, and
[getting-started.md](getting-started.md) for full installation. For what the runtime guarantees, read
[security-and-privacy-model.md](security-and-privacy-model.md) first. The documents below fall into
three groups: **specifications** (normative for the prototype), **guides** (how a component
works and how to operate it), and **reports** (dated milestone records with the evidence behind
each claim). Reports are historical: a later report or the current artifacts in
[dist/README.md](../dist/README.md) supersede earlier numbers.

## Specifications

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| [security-and-privacy-model.md](security-and-privacy-model.md) | **The security and privacy model, version 2** (normative): the trusted computing base per component and per extension; the adversaries, the compromised model included; properties P-1…P-19, each with its mechanism in both runtimes, its conformance cases, its experiment and its residual; what is not protected; the privacy model and the planned Agent Data Flow and unplanned-call rule; checked by `scripts/check_security_model.py` |
| [spec/agent-pkg-v0.md](../spec/agent-pkg-v0.md) | The `agent.pkg` container: manifest, integrity statement, signature, parsing limits |
| [spec/workflow-v0.md](../spec/workflow-v0.md) | The `workflow.v0` execution profile: node types, state, waves, validation |
| [spec/network-v0.md](../spec/network-v0.md) | `network.v0`: bounded, model-chosen delegation inside `workflow.v0` (declared roles with programs, edges with use caps, a hop cap, a shared state with per-role views, the `route` chosen by the model under a runtime-built enum, the worst case computed from the declaration and reserved before the first activation, the audit of every handoff, the enforcement cases); the machine contract in [spec/network-v0/](../spec/network-v0/), the test package and the travel network in [examples/network/](../examples/network/); normative for agentpkg 0.7.0 (the Chrome port is T26) |
| [spec/conversation-v0.md](../spec/conversation-v0.md) | `conversation.v0`: turns over a declared persistent state inside `workflow.v0`, the `consent` node and the gate before consequential tools, per-turn and per-conversation budgets with whole-turn reservation, `once` per conversation, the transcript and one audit chain across turns, the enforcement cases; machine contracts in [spec/conversation-v0/](../spec/conversation-v0/), the test package in [examples/conversation/](../examples/conversation/); normative for agentpkg 0.6.0 and Chrome core 0.4.0 (T24) |
| [spec/compute-v0.md](../spec/compute-v0.md) | `compute.v0`: WebAssembly core modules as pure functions inside `workflow.v0` (the member, the structural requirements and the instruction gate, the ABI, the limits, the failures and audit, the enforcement cases); machine contracts in [spec/compute-v0/](../spec/compute-v0/), examples in [examples/compute/](../examples/compute/); normative for agentpkg 0.5.0 and Chrome core 0.3.0 |
| [spec/memory-v0.md](../spec/memory-v0.md) | `memory.v0`: the user-owned memory of Markdown records (the record document, the graph, recall, proposals, the agent document, export and import); machine contracts and worked examples in [spec/memory-v0/](../spec/memory-v0/); normative for agentpkg 0.4.0 and Chrome core 0.2.0 |
| [spec/extensions/profiles-v0.md](../spec/extensions/profiles-v0.md) | Publisher-declared profiles (`org.webagents:profiles-v0`), a noncritical manifest extension that groups declared authority and grants none |

Evidence files referenced by the reports live in
[examples/verification/](../examples/verification/) and recorded run directories under
[examples/](../examples/README.md). Absolute paths in those files were replaced by `<repo>`
(this checkout), `~` (the recording user's home directory) and `$TMPDIR`; nothing else in them
was changed.

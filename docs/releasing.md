# Releasing WebAgents

How a release is prepared and verified, the artifacts of the current release (v0.2.0, the code the
paper describes) and of v0.1.0, and the checklist to complete before the repository is published.
Nothing here rewrites git history.

## Decisions for v0.2.0

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| License | Apache License 2.0 (`Apache-2.0`): root [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE), a copy in `agentpkg/LICENSE` for the wheel (setuptools `license-files` cannot reach `../`), SPDX `license` fields in `agentpkg/pyproject.toml`, `citation-resolver/pyproject.toml`, `demo/webair/pyproject.toml` and `openclaw-agent-browser/package.json` |
| Third-party material | listed with its terms in [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md): CPython-derived tables and expressions (PSF License), and TypeBox and OpenClaw plugin-SDK code bundled into the plugin artifact (MIT). v0.2.0 adds no bundled dependency and no third-party asset (the WebAir site uses only its own CSS and templates) |
| Internal slide deck | `Portable AI Agents and the OpenClaw Agent-Native Browser.pdf` is not in the tree (removed in `f539475`) and is git-ignored, as is any PDF at the repository root. It remains in history (`d18b839`) |
| Third-party full text | the legacy runner's raw live outputs (`examples/demo-live`, `demo-live-final`, `demo-live-fulltext`) reproduced third-party abstracts and PDF text with author e-mail addresses. They are kept locally under the ignored `/private/` directory and are not in the tree; their sanitized summaries in `examples/verification/` remain. They remain in history (`d18b839` to `f9f6dd2`). Recorded runs that the reports and the paper's experiments use stay, with the notice in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` §4 |
| History | no rewrite. The paper cites commits `23eac90` (contract enforcement) and `9d78ca5` (contract overhead), and the experiments' result directories record them, so both must stay reachable from `main`: integrate branches by fast-forward or merge commit, never by squash or rebase |
| Paper Table I | the six run records stay on the recording host. The README says which evidence the repository contains: a recomputed check of both Literature Review runs, two other recorded Meeting Agenda 0.2.2 runs, and a recomputed check of both WebAir runs with their audit chains re-verified |
| Hosted services | the Citation Resolver named by the signed Literature Review package and the WebAir origin named by the signed WebAir 0.3.0 package stay reachable for this release. Both are documented as external research/demo dependencies of live runs only. The WebAir origin is deployed from the allowlisted bundle that `demo/webair/deploy/bundle.py` writes, never from `demo/webair/` itself, which holds the demo host's resources file |
| Version | repository `v0.2.0`, with the research-prototype status stated in the README and the release notes. Component versions stay `agentpkg` 0.2.2 and Agent Browser plugin 0.1.0. The runtime reports the agentpkg version: the signed packages declare their minimum runtime against it, the paper's experiments recorded it, and the contract enforcement experiment's runtime-version cases treat 0.2.3, 0.3.0 and 1.0.0 as newer than the runtime. The plugin's tool implementations carry their version inside the Run Plans. Each artifact is identified by its SHA-256 |
| WebAir alias | `dist/webair.agent.pkg` stays 0.1.0: the recorded discovery, serving and live-demo evidence pins it to 0.1.0's bytes. The current WebAir is the versioned `dist/webair-0.3.0.agent.pkg` |
| Code and the paper's experiments | the contract enforcement results were produced at `23eac90`; the contract overhead results at `9d78ca5`, whose production code (`agentpkg/src`, the plugin's `src/`) is this release's. Between the two, the production code changed four times: the loopback bind fix in `agentpkg/src/agentpkg/browser/server.py` (no reverse DNS lookup), website discovery, host-owned capabilities, and the operator bindings file with a task-form fix (plugin only). After each of the first three, rerunning the contract enforcement paper preset reproduced every one of the 9,099 outcomes and every summary and LaTeX table byte for byte. On the v0.2.0 source, a final rerun did the same (see the checklist) |

## Release artifacts

Built from a clean clone of the release commit's tree; staged locally, outside git, in the ignored
`private/release-v0.2.0/`.

| Asset | Identity | Source in the repository |
|---|---|---|
| `agentpkg-0.2.2-py3-none-any.whl` | agentpkg 0.2.2 with website discovery and host-owned resources, Apache-2.0 metadata | `dist/` (rebuilt for v0.2.0; see [dist/README.md](../dist/README.md)) |
| `agentpkg-0.2.2.tar.gz` | agentpkg 0.2.2 source distribution | built from `agentpkg/` |
| `agent-browser.tgz` | OpenClaw plugin `agent-browser` 0.1.0 as of v0.2.0, built with OpenClaw 2026.9.5 | built from `openclaw-agent-browser/` |
| `meeting-agenda-0.2.2.agent.pkg` | `org.webagents.meeting-agenda` 0.2.2, digest `dbd2eb81…4679`, signer `sha256:2bcc374a…c5c4` | `dist/` (unchanged; not re-signed) |
| `literature-review-0.2.5.agent.pkg` | `org.webagents.literature-review` 0.2.5, digest `cef9ebd6…55b5`, signer `sha256:c5ca9763…5232` | `dist/` (unchanged; not re-signed) |

| `meeting-agenda-publisher.pub.pem`, `literature-review-publisher.pub.pem`, `webair-publisher.pub.pem` | the development public keys of the three signers | `examples/keys/` |
| `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` | ship beside `agent-browser.tgz`, because `openclaw plugins pack` writes only `package.json`, `openclaw.plugin.json` and the bundled `dist/` files into it | repository root |
| `SHA256SUMS` | the list below | |

The wheel, the plugin artifact and the signed packages are reproducible: rebuilding them from the
release commit as below gives the same bytes (for v0.2.0, two independent clean builds of the
wheel and of the plugin artifact matched; the signed packages were not rebuilt). The sdist is not
byte-reproducible (its tar entries carry file times), so publish the file whose hash
is recorded here, or record the hash of the one you build.

### v0.1.0

Tagged `v0.1.0` at `319cc3e` while the repository was private ([notes](release-notes-v0.1.0.md)).

## The development line's versions

`main` is the development line (D-019); the v0.2.0 release stays on `paper-cic2026`. Each format
change opens a runtime version, and a package that uses it declares that version as its minimum, so
an older runtime refuses it by version before anything runs (D-188, D-210). The current versions on
`main`; identities and hashes are in [dist/README.md](../dist/README.md):

| Component | Version | Since | What it brought |
|---|---|---|---|
| agentpkg (Python reference) | 0.7.1, `dist/agentpkg-0.7.1-py3-none-any.whl` (the 0.7.0, 0.6.1 and 0.6.0 wheels kept) | T26 | 0.7.0 with T25 review 2's fixes and the execution host's `role_budgets`; 0.7.0 (T25) brought network.v0 ([`spec/network-v0.md`](../spec/network-v0.md)): the `network` object and node, roles with programs, edges with use caps, the hop cap, the shared state with per-role views, the model-chosen `route` under a runtime-built enum, the transition check, the worst case computed from the declaration and reserved before the first activation, `inspect` and the control plane describing the envelope |
| agentpkg | 0.6.1, `dist/agentpkg-0.6.1-py3-none-any.whl` | T24 | T23 review 2's fixes: host inputs (worker slots, memory inputs) refused before `--out`, a consent host may not claim `plan`, the reason pattern, the refused commit reported |
| agentpkg | 0.6.0, `dist/agentpkg-0.6.0-py3-none-any.whl` | T23 | conversation.v0 ([`spec/conversation-v0.md`](../spec/conversation-v0.md)): the `conversation` object, the `consent` node and the gate on consented permissions, `once` per conversation, one audit chain across turns, `agentpkg converse` |
| agentpkg | 0.5.0, `dist/agentpkg-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl` | T21 | compute.v0 ([`spec/compute-v0.md`](../spec/compute-v0.md)): WebAssembly modules as `compute` nodes, the `compute` permission kind, binary `.wasm` members; the `wasmtime` extra (`agentpkg[compute]`) runs them |
| agentpkg | 0.4.0, `dist/agentpkg-0.4.0-py3-none-any.whl` | T20 | memory.v0 ([`spec/memory-v0.md`](../spec/memory-v0.md)) |
| agentpkg | 0.3.0, `dist/agentpkg-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl` | T13 | answer checks, the `feedback` request line |
| Chrome core (`SUPPORTED_RUNTIME_VERSION`) | 0.7.0 with core and extension 0.5.0 | T26 | network.v0 in the Chrome Agent Browser (D-290…D-293): the bound, the rules with the reference's messages, the runner with a refused route re-asked (R-28), the plan's envelope re-derived by the runner, the agent page's "How it delegates", the run page's route decisions and usage by role; 0.6.0 / core 0.4.0 (T24) brought conversation.v0 in the Chrome Agent Browser (D-270…D-274): the CLI `converse`, a conversation as a record between turns with each turn a run on the execution host, the consent card in the chat surface (a payment or a personal record always asked; presets and signed policies may pre-decide the other kinds), one chain across turns, the export of D-272, the inline recall card under an input switch (D-273); 0.5.0 / core 0.3.0 (T22) brought compute.v0 |
| WebAir | 0.8.0, `dist/webair-0.8.0.agent.pkg` (D-274; signed 2026-10-21 with the user's approval; runtime minimum 0.6.0) | T24 | a conversation: one message per turn, the intents, the persistent state (history, known fares, the open quote, the confirmation), the consent step `confirm-purchase` with the quote's facts before the simulated purchase, `once` one purchase per conversation; 0.7.0 (T22, `dist/webair-0.7.0.agent.pkg`, kept) brought the fare totals verified by the fares module and the larger `remember` step (B-220); 0.6.0 (T20) the travel profile from memory |
| Literature Review | 0.2.9, `dist/literature-review-0.2.9.agent.pkg` (runtime minimum 0.5.0) | T22 | candidate deduplication in the bookkeeping module; 0.2.8 (T20) brought the research profile, the agent's notes and a review proposal |
| Meeting Agenda | 0.2.2, `dist/meeting-agenda.agent.pkg` | v0.2.0 | — |
| Travel Network | 0.1.0, `dist/travel-network-0.1.0.agent.pkg` (D-290; signed 2026-10-24 with the user's approval under the development key `webagents-travel-network`; runtime minimum 0.7.0) | T26 | the shipped network.v0 example: a front man consulting flight, hotel and calendar roles on the WebAir origin's fictional travel services, at most 6 handoffs, 8 model calls, 19 remote calls, 48,000 tokens |
| Demo agent index | 1.6.0, `examples/agent-index.json` (1.5.0, 1.4.0 and 1.3.0 kept as `agent-index-1.5.0.json`, `agent-index-1.4.0.json` and `agent-index-1.3.0.json`) | T26 | names WebAir 0.8.0, Literature Review 0.2.9 and the travel network; 1.5.0 (T24) named WebAir 0.8.0 and Literature Review 0.2.9 |
| OpenClaw plugin | 0.1.0, frozen (D-029) | v0.2.0 | runs packages up to WebAir 0.5.0 and Literature Review 0.2.7 |

A changed package is a new version, a new signature and a new row in `dist/README.md`; an unchanged
package is never re-signed. A version signed but never pushed, deployed or used may be replaced by
the user's decision (T15's 0.2.7, T20's 0.6.0); once it has left the machine it is fixed.

## Building and checking the artifacts

From a clean checkout of the release commit. Stale `agentpkg/build/` or
`openclaw-agent-browser/dist/` directories from earlier builds can leak into an artifact, and the
package builder refuses stray files such as `.DS_Store` in `agents/`, so do not build in a working
copy that has them.

```sh
# agentpkg wheel and sdist (setuptools pinned, fixed timestamp)
python3 -m venv /tmp/build-env && /tmp/build-env/bin/pip install 'build>=1.2,<2' 'setuptools==84.0.0'
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1790965957 /tmp/build-env/bin/python -m build --no-isolation --outdir /tmp/agentpkg-dist agentpkg

# the plugin artifact (Node 24 >= 24.16 or >= 26.1)
(cd openclaw-agent-browser && npm ci && npm run build && npm run validate && npm run pack)
git status --porcelain     # must be empty: `npm run build` regenerates openclaw.plugin.json

# consistency of the release tree: package identities, dist/ SHA-256 list, licenses, wheel = source
python3 -m venv agentpkg/.venv && agentpkg/.venv/bin/pip install -e './agentpkg[dev]'
agentpkg/.venv/bin/python scripts/check_release.py --built-wheel /tmp/agentpkg-dist/agentpkg-0.2.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

The Chrome Agent Browser's zip (not part of v0.2.0; a store upload is U5):

```sh
(cd chrome-agent-browser && npm ci && npm run build && npm run pack && npm run check-pack)
# dist/chrome-agent-browser-<version>.zip and .contents.txt (sha256, bytes, path per member;
# the zip's own hash last). The zip carries LICENSE.txt and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt.
```

The same sources and Node release pack to the same bytes. Across Node releases the members stay
identical while the deflate stream may not (each Node ships its own zlib), so publish the
`.contents.txt` beside the zip and record the Node version that packed it (D-093). The version is
`package.json`'s and the manifest's, which `check-pack` holds equal.

Use Python 3.11 ≥ 3.11.10, 3.12 ≥ 3.12.4 or 3.13 for every environment here: earlier patch releases
lack CPython's `ipaddress` fix (CVE-2024-4032), and the URL-policy tests fail on them.

Never re-sign an unchanged `.agent.pkg`: its archive SHA-256, digest and signature are part of the
recorded evidence and of the paper's experiment manifests. A changed package gets a new version,
a new signature and a new row in `dist/README.md`.

[CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) repeats every check on Ubuntu and macOS: the Python suite on
3.11 and 3.13 (Ubuntu) and 3.12 and 3.13 (macOS, where `setup-python` has no 3.11 newer than the
unpatched 3.11.9), the offline acceptance scripts, the wheel and sdist build, an installed-wheel
verification and fixture run of the packages (including WebAir 0.3.0 and 0.4.0), `check_release.py`, the
plugin suite on Node 24 and 26 with no skipped test, build, validation, packing, artifact
inspection and isolated install, the WebAir origin and package-contract suite, the Citation
Resolver suite and the experiments' test suites; and, since T7, the Chrome Agent Browser on Node 24
and 26 (typecheck, tests with no skip, build, pack, the zip's structure check, a second build that
must pack to the same bytes) and the cross-runtime conformance suite. It needs no credential, model, OpenClaw
configuration, Ollama, live Crossref, hosted resolver or WebAir deployment. It runs on pushes to
`main` and on pull requests.

## Public-release checklist

Status of the v0.2.0 release-engineering pass (2026-10-03).

| | Item | How it was checked |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` present | root `LICENSE` is the apache.org text, SHA-256 `cfc7749b…3d30`; `agentpkg/LICENSE` is identical (`check_release.py`) |
| ✅ | Package metadata licenses consistent | `Apache-2.0` in `agentpkg/pyproject.toml` (+ `license-files`), `citation-resolver/pyproject.toml`, `demo/webair/pyproject.toml`, `openclaw-agent-browser/package.json` and `package-lock.json` |
| ✅ | License in the Python distributions | the wheel carries `License-Expression: Apache-2.0` and `licenses/LICENSE`; the sdist carries `LICENSE` |
| ✅ | Third-party attribution | `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, unchanged: v0.2.0 adds no bundled dependency or third-party asset |
| ✅ | Internal deck not tracked in the tree | not in `git ls-files`; ignored by `/Portable AI Agents …pdf` and `/*.pdf` |
| ✅ | Local/private files ignored | `/private/` (including the staged release assets), `.claude/`, virtualenvs, `node_modules/`, build output, `examples/my-*`, `*.tgz`, keys and `.env` files (`check_release.py`); the demo host's resources file is fictional and is never deployed |
| ✅ | README consistent with the code and the paper | three packages, quickstart (rerun from a fresh clone), Table I (all six columns against the recorded evidence), the experiments' headline numbers against their result directories, external services, status and limitations |
| ✅ | Paper's commits reachable | `23eac90` and `9d78ca5` are ancestors of `main`, which carries every commit of the former WebAir branch |
| ✅ | Paper's experiment results committed | contract enforcement `results/2026-10-02T12-38-15Z_paper_paper`; contract overhead `results/2026-10-03T*_paper-webair-run{1,2,3}` and `…T16-14-20Z_paper-webair-pooled`, whose tables match the paper's |
| ✅ | Contract enforcement results reproduce on this source | a full paper-preset rerun on the v0.2.0 production code (into a scratch directory) gave the paper run's outcome for each of the 9,099 cases, with byte-identical LaTeX tables |
| ✅ | Full Python tests | `pytest agentpkg/tests` from a fresh clone on 3.13.5: 1,223 passed, 2 skipped (the opt-in live tests) |
| ✅ | Plugin typecheck, tests, build | 527 tests, none skipped; build, validate, pack, isolated install (`npm run verify`) from a fresh clone |
| ✅ | WebAir origin and package contract | 294 tests, none skipped, and `python -m publisher check` (generated files current), from a fresh install of `requirements-dev.txt` |
| ✅ | Citation Resolver tests | 132 passed, from a fresh clone |
| ✅ | Experiments' test suites | contract overhead 35, contract enforcement 101 (separate processes) |
| ✅ | Offline acceptance scripts | the eight CI runs, including `verify_webair` and `verify_webair_discovery` |
| ✅ | Current Python distribution | wheel rebuilt from current source, reproducibly; `check_release.py --built-wheel` |
| ✅ | Current plugin distribution | built twice from clean clones with identical bytes; contents are exactly the manifest, `package.json` and the bundles |
| ✅ | Signed artifacts verified | Meeting Agenda 0.2.2, Literature Review 0.2.5 and WebAir 0.3.0 with the installed wheel; fixture runs pass; the public WebAir origin serves exactly `dist/webair-0.3.0.agent.pkg` |
| ✅ | Secret scan | gitleaks over the full history and trufflehog/gitleaks over the extracted artifacts: only documented test fixtures and hash-like build keys; no personal path, credential or private signing key |
| ✅ | CI rehearsal | every `run:` step of every job in `ci.yml`, each job in its own fresh clone, on macOS with Python 3.13 and Node 26: all six jobs pass |
| ⏳ | CI on GitHub | the WebAir commits had never run in CI (it runs on `main` and pull requests only). **Check the first run on `main` on both operating systems**, including the Linux and the other Python/Node matrix legs the rehearsal did not cover |
| ⏳ | Tag and GitHub Release | after CI passes |
| ⏳ | Visibility | the maintainer keeps the repository private for now (anonymous review) |

### Human-only steps

1. If the paper is under anonymous review, confirm that publishing the repository does not
   violate the venue's policy. The git history (author names and e-mail addresses) and the
   repository URL identify the authors. When publishing is allowed, fill in the README's clone URL
   (`<this-repository-url>`) and the citation's author field.
2. Watch the GitHub Actions run on `main` on both operating systems and fix anything that only
   shows there.
3. Create and push the `v0.2.0` tag on the commit CI passed:
   `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "WebAgents v0.2.0" <commit> && git push origin v0.2.0`.
4. Create the GitHub Release from [release-notes-v0.2.0.md](release-notes-v0.2.0.md), attaching the
   assets above and `SHA256SUMS` (staged in `private/release-v0.2.0/`; rebuild them as above if
   that copy is gone, and record the new sdist hash).
5. Change the repository's visibility when intended.

### Known technical items, not blocking

- `agentpkg browser-serve` without `--cache-dir` uses Python's temporary directory, which is the
  shared `/tmp` on most Linux systems ([browser-control-plane.md](browser-control-plane.md)). The
  plugin always passes a private one. A per-user default is a change for a later version.
- On Linux the PDF reader's `RLIMIT_AS` cap is enforced for the first time: macOS refuses to set
  it, so it was never active during development. CI exercises the reader on Linux.
- No live Agent Browser run on a Linux OpenClaw host has been accepted.
- `agent.pkg` 0.1 has no optional tools, so a host without the three resource types cannot run
  WebAir 0.2.0 or later. Optional tools need a format change.
- The hosted Citation Resolver and WebAir origin run on a free hosting plan with no availability
  guarantee; WebAir's fictional schedule ends on 31 December 2027.

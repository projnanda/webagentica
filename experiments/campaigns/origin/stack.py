"""The campaign stack (PROTOCOL.md §2.1): WebAir's origin in its injection mode, the logging sink
and, when asked, the Citation Resolver in the same mode, each on `127.0.0.1` over TLS under the
campaign CA.

    with CampaignStack(run_dir) as stack:
        stack.hosts    # {public hostname: ("127.0.0.1", port)}: the host mapping the drivers dial
        stack.ca       # the campaign CA's PEM path: only the drivers trust it
        stack.origin_log, stack.sink.log

One stack serves every run of a campaign slot; the per-run fixture key travels in the request
header, so runs never share an insertion.

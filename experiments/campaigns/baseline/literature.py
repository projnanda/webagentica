"""The framework agent's port of Literature Review 0.2.9 (PROTOCOL.md §2.5, E2's and E3's TS-L,
D-358): one Agents SDK agent with the package's tools, policy, budgets and the TS-L answer step.

- **Tools** (rule 1): the tools our plan grants on the same run, as function tools with their
  declared schemas (`scholarly-search`, `citation-resolver`, and `paper-reader` only when the run
  is given selected files); the profile and notes tools are not granted on our side
  (`use_profile`, `keep_notes` false), so not offered. Each call runs **agentpkg's own handler**
  (`py_driver.literature_handlers`: `create_handlers` as `agentpkg run` binds it, the search in
  the process's Crossref lane) under the same host mapping as `Py` (`driver/hostmap.py`): the same
  adapters, the same URL and address policy before any dial, the resolver dialed at the campaign
  stack, Crossref live, the same dial log (T31 review 2, carry-over 3: no Literature Review tool
  takes a URL; `paper-reader` takes an opaque file id the host maps).
- **Instructions** (rule 3): the skills of the graph's workers in node order and
  `HOST-literature-review.md`.
- **Budgets** (rule 9): `max_turns` = our plan's model-call bound (7 `llm` nodes, and the
  screening and evidence maps' `llm` steps at 20 items each: 47), the policy's `hard_tokens`, the
  per-tool and remote-call caps, the graph's deadline.
- **Answer** (rule 4): the answer step (TUNING.md T-1) with `tasks/literature-answer.schema.json`.
- **Policy** (rule 7): Progent's released code with `policies/literature-review.json`.

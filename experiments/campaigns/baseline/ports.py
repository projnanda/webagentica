"""What a framework port takes from the signed package (PROTOCOL.md §2.5 rules 1 and 3, D-350).

- **Tools** (rule 1): one function tool per declared tool, with the declared input schema as its
  parameters (non-strict, so the schema reaches the model as declared) and the declared
  description. The function-tool name is the tool id with `.` replaced by `_` (the chat APIs accept
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` only); the record keeps the tool id, so the oracle reads the same names on every
  side.
- **Instructions** (rule 3): the package's skills concatenated in graph order (each skill once, at
  its first use; the YAML front matter dropped), followed by the committed host paragraph
  (`baseline/HOST-<port>.md`), identical across tasks.

/**
 * The Run surface (T5): task in, one bounded run, result out. Ported from
 * `openclaw-agent-browser/src/ui/run.ts` (the frozen reference plugin, D-029) onto the
 * extension's message contract; never imported across the two projects.
 *
 * This is the page's only way to execute anything, and it adds no authority of its own. Run is
 * offered only when the worker's readiness (`run.readiness`: the preflight, the receipt's
 * remaining time, no active run, an execution host) and the package's own input schema
 * (`run.validateInput`) both say yes for exactly the plan and the task on screen, and
 * `run.start` re-verifies all of it before the host re-verifies the bytes. What the page sends
 * is the task and nothing else: the model, the tool bindings, the permissions and the package all
 * come from the run plan. Progress is read, never inferred: stages, workers and counters are the
 * runner's checkpointed snapshot. Package-provided labels are cosmetic text, rendered with
 * `textContent` like everything else a package wrote. A closed panel reconnects by reading the
 * stored record again (`run.list`'s `active`, `run.get`), since the run lives on the host (D-070).

 * Runs from the browser (T5, D-070…D-073): the service worker's half of execution. It is the
 * reference plugin's `execution.ts` and `run-manager.ts` over the Chrome core: readiness and
 * task validation before Run is offered, the one-time lease (`LeaseRegistry`, with `once` spent
 * at the first lease and the spent receipts persisted), the run's invocation written to IndexedDB
 * for the execution host, cancel, the record and artifact reads a view needs, the export bundle,
 * and the rule that a run whose host is gone is `interrupted` and never resumed. The manager
 * decides *whether* a run starts; the host (`execution/execute.ts`) re-verifies and executes.
 *
 * Nothing here is package-specific (D-009): every fact comes from the plan, the receipt, the

/**
 * One run on the execution host (D-070, D-071): the portable half of the host, with no Worker,
 * Chrome or DOM dependency, so the same function runs inside the offscreen document's Worker and
 * inside the unit tests. It composes T4's `ExecutionSession` over the stores and transports the
 * host supplies, re-verifying the bytes against the plan (`begin`) before any instruction is
 * rendered, and writes a checkpoint after every wave (`state.committed`): the record, the
 * progress snapshot, the audit so far and the usage so far. At the end it writes the artifacts
 * and the settled record. Nothing here decides authority: the plan, the authorization and the
 * input were frozen by the service worker; the host refuses what does not re-verify.
 *
 * Every write is one atomic step that leaves a settled record alone (T5 review 1, finding 1):
 * when the service worker has already ended this run (it declared the host gone, D-071, or
 * cleared the run), the host's execution stops at its next checkpoint and writes nothing more,
 * so a record the worker settled is never overwritten by a host that was still alive. A cancel
 * the service worker stored is never lost either (T5 review 2, finding 1): the host reads the
 * flag when it starts and merges it on every write, so a Cancel accepted while the run was
 * still preparing, when no Worker existed to receive `host.cancel`, still ends the run.

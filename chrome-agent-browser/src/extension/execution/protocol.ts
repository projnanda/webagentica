/**
 * The protocol between the service worker and the execution host (D-070). The host is an
 * offscreen document that runs each run in a dedicated Worker; the worker (the one state owner,
 * D-035) decides to start a run, writes its invocation to IndexedDB, and asks the host to run it.
 * The host never decides anything about authority: it re-verifies the bytes against the plan
 * (`ExecutionSession.begin`) and executes.
 *
 * What travels in `host.start` and nowhere else: the key of the provider the plan bound (and no
 * other, D-195), the memory when the plan grants a record or binds a memory tool (the person's
 * records, which the broker resolves for `host_resource` bindings and whose sealed values the
 * egress guards refuse anywhere else; null otherwise), and the origins the plan allows the run to reach (D-193), which the
 * host's transports enforce beneath the core URL gate. The secrets live encrypted in
 * `chrome.storage.local` (D-191) and in the host's memory for the run; no record, checkpoint or
 * artifact carries them.

/**
 * Running one compute call in a nested Worker per call (compute.v0 §4, §5; D-250, D-251): the
 * port of `agentpkg/compute/engine.py` onto the engine every host has, V8.
 *
 * A call is one fresh Worker, one fresh instance, and the Worker is terminated when it answers,
 * when the deadline passes and when the run is cancelled: `terminate()` is the CPU bound here,
 * since V8 meters no fuel (`fuel_consumed` is null, D-244) and a thread cannot interrupt itself.
 * Modules compile once per run (`compile`, the preflight of D-245: a module V8 refuses is
 * `module_invalid`) and the compiled `WebAssembly.Module` travels to the call's Worker by
 * structured clone, so no call pays for compilation. Memory is bounded by the module's own
 * declared maximum, which V8 enforces; the preflight (C-31) has refused every module whose maximum
 * is above the host's page bound, so nothing is ever lowered.
 *
 * The engine never throws for a module's own failure: a trap, a passed deadline or an ABI
 * violation come back as a `ComputeOutcome` with a reason, and the runtime records it. It throws
 * only when the host is at fault (`EngineFault`, C-40's `worker_error`: a Worker that died without
 * answering, a module not compiled before the call) and when the run is cancelled (the signal's
 * reason, a `CancelledError`). Where the Worker comes from is the host's: `spawn()` is
 * `new Worker("compute-worker.js", {type: "module"})` in the extension and a `worker_threads`
 * adapter in the CLI; the host also names the engine (`chrome/155.0.0.0`, the major version
 * user-agent reduction leaves, B-229; `node/v26.9.0`).

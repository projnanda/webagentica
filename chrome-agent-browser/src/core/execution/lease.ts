/**
 * One-time execution leases: how immutable bytes leave the control plane (`browser/lease.py`,
 * `control.py::issue_execution_lease`) and the runner-side re-verification the reference splits
 * across the plugin's preflight and `execution/artifact.py`.
 *
 * A lease is the smaller thing than a path: a private copy of the session's snapshot, created only
 * when the plan is ready *right now*, named by a random identifier, valid for a bounded time and
 * consumable once. Issuing one is gated on the same question every other gate asks, recomputed by
 * T3's `preflight` and handed in here (the registry never computes trust itself), plus the checks
 * the runner adds: the bytes verified against the plan (archive hash, digest, id, version,
 * signature, signer), every bound tool still the implementation it was approved as, every granted
 * resource still the record it was chosen as, the model still offered, the receipt outlasting the
 * run, and `once` spent by the first lease. The registry executes nothing.

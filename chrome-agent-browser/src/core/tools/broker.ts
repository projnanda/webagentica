/**
 * One generic `ToolHandler` per binding a Run Plan froze (`toolbridge/handler.py` and
 * `tool-broker.ts` in one process). The runtime remains the authority: `Runtime.callTool` has
 * already checked the role allowlist, the permission grants, the explicit approval, the
 * per-tool and remote-call budgets and the package's own input schema before a handler is
 * reached, and validates the result against the package's own output schema afterwards. The
 * handler adds defence in depth on the way out and the way back:
 *
 * - it dispatches only the implementation whose id and digest the plan froze, and resolves it
 *   among the definitions *this run* was constructed with;
 * - before a slot, a socket or a resolver, it refuses arguments that carry a sealed host value
 *   bound for a tool it was not granted to reach (`egress.ts`);
 * - it serves at most the binding's concurrency and spacing (`pacer.ts`), and the binding's own
 *   deadline bounds the wait for a slot and the dispatch (the package's timeout runs in the
 *   runtime above, so a call ends at whichever is earlier, as the reference's `min` does);
 * - it bounds the arguments and the output to the limits the plan approved (the described
 *   binding's, which the digest froze), and a `host_resource` answer must be attributed to
 *   exactly one grant of this plan;
 * - it records `tool.dispatched` and `tool.settled` in the runtime's own audit: the binding
 *   identity and, for a resource, the grant it came from, never the value;
 * - a remote call that both the binding and the package declare a read, and that failed
 *   transiently, is sent again up to twice (D-152), each retry a remote call the runtime checks
 *   against its budgets; a `citation.resolve` binding whose descriptor names the built-in Crossref
 *   lookup may have a DOI answered by it when the resolver stays unavailable (D-153).
 *
 * Codes are shared verbatim with `agentpkg.toolbridge.errors` (`tool_not_bound`,
 * `tool_binding_stale`, `tool_request_invalid`, `tool_response_invalid`, `tool_unavailable`,
 * `tool_timeout`, `tool_cancelled`, `tool_transport_error`, ...).

/**
 * Pacing one host implementation (`tool-pacer.ts`): at most `maxConcurrent` calls in flight
 * per binding id and at least `minIntervalMs` between two starts, shared by every run in this
 * process. A call that cannot start yet waits its turn (first in, first out) rather than being
 * refused; the wait is bounded by the caller's signal, so pacing can delay a call but never
 * outlive it. Nothing here retries a request; a broker retry (D-152) acquires its own turn.
 *
 * The interval also separates a call's **answer** from the next start (D-081 as amended, T6): a
 * browser reuses one connection to a service, so only the first request pays the connection's
 * setup and reaches the service late, and a second request started one interval after the first
 * *started* reached Crossref under a second after it and was refused with 429 (the first live
 * Chrome run, 2026-10-08). The reference's Node transport opens a connection per request, so its
 * start-to-start spacing survives the trip; measuring from the answer as well restores that
 * guarantee here. It only ever adds delay; the values (`maxConcurrent`, `minIntervalMs`) are the
 * binding's, unchanged.

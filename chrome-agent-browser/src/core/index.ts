/**
 * The portable core of the Chrome Agent Browser (D-024).
 *
 * Opens, parses, verifies and summarizes `agent.pkg` packages exactly as `agentpkg` does,
 * with no browser dependency. Everything here runs in Node, in an extension's service
 * worker and in a web page alike; the shell under `src/extension` is one consumer, the CLI
 * another. Execution lives under `execution/` (T4) and runs only what a verified lease hands it.

/**
 * The in-browser route (D-440, D-445): a model the extension itself runs on the machine's GPU,
 * inside the browser, with no application beside it (D-310, D-311). The core states the contract
 * and never touches an engine: the shell implements `InBrowserEnginePort` over the engine Worker
 * that lives in the offscreen document (D-441), exactly as `builtin-port.ts` implements
 * `BuiltinModelPort` over the Prompt API, and `src/core` stays free of WebGPU and the DOM.
 *
 * What the adapter delivers is what every route delivers (`router.ts`): the bundled output schema
 * goes to the engine as a grammar constraint (`GGUF_GRAMMAR_RULES`: the schema as given), the
 * router still parses and validates every answer, usage is the engine's own count (thinking tokens
 * included in the output count) or the call fails `model_usage_unavailable`, a `length` finish is
 * reported as a `length` stop so the router fails the node as truncated, and an abort stops the
 * engine (the spike measured about 0.3 s). There is no transport: no URL gate, no address policy,
 * nothing to refuse, and the observer (D-028) still sees the request under `in-browser:<entry>`.
 * Design: `docs/design/in-browser-inference.md` §4.

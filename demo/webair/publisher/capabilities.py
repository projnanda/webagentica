"""Reference runs of the host-owned capability scenarios, and the WebAir answers they need.

For each scenario in `capability_scenarios()` this runs the package's own graph in the generic
interpreter, with the person's decisions as grants, the demo host's selected resources behind
the package's host-resource tools (`host.py`), a scripted model router and the in-process
json_http binding of WebAir's API. It keeps:

* every request WebAir received and its answer, so the Agent Browser's acceptance tests can
  serve exactly these at the broker boundary without a network;
* how the run ended, so those tests can compare the real host path with this reference.

The output is `examples/webair-capability-scenarios.json`. It contains the demo's fictional
passenger details in WebAir's booking requests, because that is what WebAir receives; it is
a demo fixture, never part of the signed package.

"""The demo host's personal resources, and what the WebAir package copies from them.

`demo/webair/host-resources.json` is what the person's OpenClaw host holds in this demo: two
travel profiles, two passenger identities and two payment methods, all fictional. It is
host configuration (`plugins.entries.agent-browser.config.hostResources.file`), never package
content: the signed package carries no name, email or payment record.

What the package does carry is each resource *type's* schema, because a package that requests
a type must declare exactly the host's schema for it (the host's binding pins its digest).
`host_schema_files` generates those copies, the same way `contract.py` generates WebAir's API
schemas from the origin, so the two cannot drift silently.

Since 0.6.0 the travel profile is read from the person's memory (memory.v0: a `memory.read`
permission for the type `travel.profile`, which answers for the legacy id
`personal.travel_profile`, spec/memory-v0.md M-17). The package then declares the type's
**record view** schema (M-16, built by agentpkg from the starter taxonomy) instead of the
host's legacy schema, and `host_schema_files` generates that instead.

`host_resource_handlers` is an in-process stand-in for the host's `host_resource` bindings
(and, since 0.6.0, its `host.memory.<type>` bindings, answering the picked resource as a record
view), used only by this publisher to record which requests WebAir receives in the demo
scenarios.
The Agent Browser's own generic implementation (`openclaw-agent-browser/src/host-resources.ts`)
is what the acceptance tests run.

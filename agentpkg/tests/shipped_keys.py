"""Which public key signed which shipped artifact.

The two reference artifacts are no longer signed by one key, and each current
one has its own. `meeting-agenda` 0.2.1 and `literature-review` 0.2.1 each carry
a **package-specific development signing key** (`literature-review` 0.2.2 and
0.2.3 are signed by the same Literature Review key as 0.2.1), because the original key's
private half does not exist on any machine this project builds on and both
packages' local-model timing policy had to change (see
`docs/package-execution-report.md` and `docs/literature-review-execution-report.md`).
The original key still signs the preserved 0.2.0 artifacts and the legacy
package, untouched.

Tests that open a shipped artifact must pin the key that actually signed *that*
artifact. Pinning the wrong one is not a weaker assertion, it is a different
one: the trust store answers `mismatch`, because a second key claiming an
already-pinned publisher id is exactly the impersonation signal it exists to
raise.

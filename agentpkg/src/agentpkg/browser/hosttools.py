"""Host tool registries and generic package/tool binding compatibility.

Two knowledge domains meet here and are deliberately kept apart, exactly as
they are for models in `hostmodels.py`:

* the **host** (OpenClaw, in the shipped integration) knows which tool
  implementations exist, where they run, what they are willing to talk to, and
  whether a credential is configured. It sends that as a bounded,
  provider-neutral **tool registry** of *binding descriptors*;
* **agentpkg** knows what a package *declares* and what those declarations
  mean. It never learns a service name, an API shape, a credential, or a
  vendor vocabulary, and it never calls anything.

Nothing in this module invokes anything. Evaluating a binding is hashing, set
membership and string equality over declared data.

Three objects with three different jobs, which the vocabulary keeps apart:

    package tool declaration   what the package asks for   (signed, in the pkg)
    host tool binding          what the host will run      (trusted, host-owned)
    tool approval              what the person allowed     (receipt, elsewhere)

The first two meet here. The third meets them in `runplan.py`.

Four rules shape the evaluation:

1. a missing host answer is `unknown`, never `false` and never `true`;
2. a package's declared `endpoint`/`domains` constrain the host binding
   *downwards* and never grant anything: a remote binding must land inside the
   domains the package declared, the network permission's resources, and the
   package's own network policy — all three — or it is incompatible. A package
   that names `example.test` cannot thereby reach it; a host that would like to
   reach somewhere else cannot do so behind that package's name either;
3. a binding's identity digest covers what it would *do*, not whether it
   happens to be up, so a momentarily unavailable implementation does not
   invalidate an authorization;
4. every check carries its own reason, so a UI can explain a verdict instead of
   asserting one.

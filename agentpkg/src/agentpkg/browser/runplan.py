"""Immutable run plans: the last artifact before execution, and still not it.

A run plan answers *exactly what would run, with whose authority, on which
model* — and then stops. It binds five things that must not be able to drift
apart between the moment a person decided and the moment something runs:

    these bytes  ·  this signer and trust state  ·  this authorization receipt
    ·  this host model  ·  this catalog state

The plan itself is frozen and hashed. What can change is the world around it,
so readiness is **recomputed on every read** rather than stored as a verdict.
A plan that was ready when it was prepared can become stale, and saying so is
the point of separating the two.

Execution-mode requirements live here rather than in the package. A package may
declare its model permission optional because it can also run from fixtures;
choosing a model-backed run is a *run-time* decision that needs that permission
anyway. The package manifest is never rewritten to express this.

# left out and that they did not approve (D-022, D-090): it is denied, never

# the other: a `tool_probe` plan binds no model, names the one tool it is for,
# and is refused by the runner as a workflow. A package whose other tools this

"""The private host-bridge wire contract: one JSON object per line, both ways.

This is the transport a future `agentpkg` execution process will use to reach
the intelligence the user selected, so it is designed as that transport rather
than as a probe-shaped detour.

    OpenClaw plugin backend  (parent, holds provider authority)
            |  stdin  <----- requests: session.begin / probe.run / session.end
            |                responses to model.* requests
            |  stdout -----> requests: model.count_tokens / model.complete
            |                responses to session.* requests
    agentpkg host bridge     (child, holds the ModelRouter contract)
            |  stderr -----> logs, diagnostics, tracebacks

Three properties make this safe enough for package data to flow through it
later:

* **it is not a network**. A pipe between a parent and the child it spawned has
  no address, no listener and no credential;
* **the method set is closed, per direction**. There is no generic dispatch, no
  name resolution, no file path, no model identifier and no OpenClaw method
  name anywhere in a frame. A method outside its direction's allowlist is an
  error, and a malformed frame ends the session;
* **stdout carries frames and nothing else**. Logging goes to stderr, so a
  stray diagnostic can never be parsed as a protocol message.

"""The private execution wire contract, and the two descriptors it replaces.

The execution session reuses the host bridge's framing — one JSON object per
line, bounded, correlated, cancellable — and changes exactly two things.

**A different protocol version.** A probe parent and an execution child can
never complete a handshake, because each peer refuses a frame carrying any
version but its own. Two components that spend money should not be able to
mistake each other for one another.

**A different method set, and no filesystem vocabulary at all.**

    OpenClaw plugin backend (parent)          agentpkg execution runner (child)
    ────────────────────────────────          ─────────────────────────────────
    execution.begin / run / cancel / end  ──▶  stdin      (fd 0)
    model.count_tokens / model.complete    ◀──  stdout     (fd 1)
    logs, diagnostics, tracebacks          ◀──  stderr     (fd 2)
    the immutable package archive          ──▶  PACKAGE_FD (fd 3, read-only)
    the run's artifact directory           ──▶  ARTIFACTS_FD (fd 4, a directory)

The parent may also ask for one host-owned `execution.tool_probe`, and the
child may ask for `tool.call`. Neither adds a destination to the wire: a tool
call names a tool the signed package declared and a binding digest the run plan
froze, and the trusted parent resolves what that means.

The child may also send `execution.progress`: identifiers and counts it derived
from the audit events it has already recorded, so the host can show a long run
moving. It carries no prompt, no model output and no tool payload, and the
parent's answer changes nothing in the run.

There is no path, no filename, no model identifier, no URL, no HTTP method, no
header and no OpenClaw method name anywhere in a frame. The child cannot open
the package from anywhere else, because it never learns where the package is;
it cannot write outside the run's artifact directory, because it never learns
where that is either; and it cannot reach a service of its own choosing,
because nothing in a frame can express one.

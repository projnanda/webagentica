"""Reading a finished run's own audit, rather than narrating it separately.

`Runtime` already emits a hash-chained audit and settled usage. This module
does not create a second record: it verifies the chain it was given and counts
what is in it, so a report says "four model calls happened" because four
`model.completed` events exist, not because something incremented a counter
alongside them.

Everything here is a pure function of the execution report. No package word,
node name or task name is special-cased, and raw model output never appears.

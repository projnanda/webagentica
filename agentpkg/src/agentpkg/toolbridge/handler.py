"""A `ToolHandler` whose implementation is the exact binding a run plan froze.

This is the only place where the generic runtime contract in
`agentpkg.interfaces.ToolHandler` meets a concrete host. It stays completely
service-neutral: it never names a provider, a service, an index, a domain or
an API shape, holds no credential, and performs no I/O of its own.
Everything service-shaped — the request, the transport, authentication, the
response contract — happens on the other side of the bridge, inside the
trusted host.

What the handler sends is deliberately small:

    {"tool_id": "<declared id>", "binding_id": "<the plan's binding>",
     "binding_sha256": "<the plan's digest>", "args": {…}}

There is no URL, no method, no header, no command and no host method name in
that frame, because there is nowhere for one to go. The host resolves the
triple against the bindings *it* holds for *this* run, and refuses anything
else. A package that could name its own destination would not be a package
declaring a capability; it would be a package holding one.

Four obligations deserve their reasoning in one place.

**The runtime remains the authority.** `Runtime.call_tool` has already checked
the role allowlist, the permission grants, the explicit tool approval, the
per-tool and remote-call budgets, and the package's own input schema before
this handler is reached, and it validates the result against the package's own
output schema afterwards. This handler adds defence in depth on the way out and
the way back; it replaces none of it.

**Nothing unbounded leaves.** Arguments are canonicalized and size-checked
before a frame is written, so a package that constructs a pathological document
fails locally rather than at someone else's server.

**The answer is checked before it is believed.** The host's envelope is a
closed field set, its binding identity must echo the one this handler holds,
and its payload must be finite JSON. The package's own output schema is then
applied by `Runtime`, which is a second, independent check against a service
that may be wrong, changed, or lying.

**Cancellation reaches the request.** An awaited call that is cancelled sends
`$/cancel` for that exact id, which the host turns into an `AbortSignal` on the
in-flight request. A workflow that stops does not leave a paid request running.

"""The scan set (M-36, M-37, M-40 step 7) and its one scanner.

The scan set of a run is fixed when the run starts: the sealed values, by record id and pointer, of
every record of the store when the run is opened with the store (a `--memory-dir` in the CLI), and
otherwise empty; in fixture mode without a store, the values at the sealed pointers of the
replayed memory-read and host-resource answers (M-62). It is an exact-value check over values the
host holds, case-insensitive, anywhere in a document, keys included, with no depth cut-off; a
document holding more strings than the scanner reads is refused unread.

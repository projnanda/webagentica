/**
 * The host side of the private execution bridge.
 *
 * It is the router bridge's sibling and shares its whole transport, because
 * the properties that matter — closed method sets, bounded frames, fail-closed
 * framing, one child, cancellation that reaches the provider — must not differ
 * between proving a model works and actually running a package on it.
 *
 * Three things are this bridge's own:
 *
 * * **a different protocol version.** `agentpkg-execution/0.1`. A probe parent
 *   and an execution child refuse each other's frames outright, so the two can
 *   never be confused for one another;
 * * **descriptors instead of paths.** The immutable package archive arrives at
 *   the child as fd 3 and the run's artifact directory as fd 4, both opened
 *   here and inherited. No filename crosses the wire in either direction, so
 *   the child can read exactly one file and write into exactly one directory;
 * * **cancellation as a request.** `execution.cancel` reaches the running
 *   workflow, which cancels its workers, which cancels their pending model
 *   calls, which aborts the provider request through the same `AbortSignal`
 *   the probe already used.
 *
 * ```text
 *   this process (Gateway)                                 spawned runner
 *   ──────────────────────                                 ──────────────
 *   execution.begin / run / cancel / end               ──▶  stdin
 *   model.count_tokens / model.complete                 ◀──  stdout
 *   tool.call (when a broker is attached)               ◀──  stdout
 *   execution.progress (when a sink is attached)        ◀──  stdout
 *   logs and diagnostics                                ◀──  stderr
 *   the leased immutable archive (read-only)            ──▶  fd 3
 *   the run's private artifact directory                ──▶  fd 4
 * ```
 *
 * `execution.progress` carries identifiers and counts the runner derived from
 * its own audit, so a caller can watch a long run without reading its output.
 * It can change nothing: the handler only records a snapshot.
